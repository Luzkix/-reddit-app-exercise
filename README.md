# Reddit App!

###Add your own posts and like/dislike posts from others! 

This miniapp focuses especially on html part, mainly on practicing with Thymeleaf templates, so it has a basic frontend implemented. Main backend business logic lies in voting system, so you can give just one like/dislike to each post (not own ofcourse). Posts are than saved in database. There is no spring security or any advanced stuff, but it is fun to play with it  :-)
